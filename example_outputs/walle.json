    "bold of disney to finance and release a movie about a megacorporation that destroys the earth",
    "i always imagined that hayao miyazaki s  my neighbor totoro  would be the first movie i ever showed my son  but sometime last summer   about 30 minutes into an eight hour flight  or roughly 29 minutes after his 2 year old mind grew bored with sitting inside a massive steel tube as it rocketed across the sky at 300 mph   i delegated the honor of choosing asa s first movie to the fine people who program delta s in flight entertainment the options were rather uninspiring  you can t bring a bottle of water through security  but  sing 2  is safe    and even the higher quality fare seemed like it might fry my kid s brain  it wasn t until i neared the end of my a z search that something jumped out at me as a viable option  not only was it a great film  but its frequently wordless storytelling also meant that i d be able to watch along from the next seat without a pair of headphones  but the real deciding factor was that   despite my deeply ingrained resentment towards the look and gentrification like energy of computer generated hollywood cartoons   this one somehow promised not to betray my pretentious and ridiculously parent brained plan of introducing asa to the movies by showing him one that reflects the most basic essence of their magic  even with disney s entire library at my disposal  it s hard to imagine i could have found a better choice the movie  of course  was  wall e   and my son watched it something like six times in a row before we landed  he alternated between taking serene naps and making spielberg faces up at the seat back screen   in the months since  i ve seen at least half of andrew stanton s fantastic post apocalyptic fable approximately once a day   twice if it s raining   and have scrambled to turn off my apple tv before it auto played  cars  more times than i can count that might sound masochistic  but i regret to inform you that it s a distressingly standard media diet for someone with a young child and a disney  account  most toddlers would beg for the ludovico technique by name if they knew what it was called  in truth  the only strange thing about it is that i haven t gotten sick of  wall e  either  this article continues on indiewire ",
    "wall e is a creepy old man who stalks a young girl and takes her out on dates while she s unconscious eve is a high strung woman who destroys everything around her and won t even explain what her job is and it s the most adorable thing ever wall e continues to convince me that part of pixar s brilliance comes from their understanding of visual storytelling  they know that character doesn t come from having your actors read their characteristics to the audience  it comes from their actions  it comes from wall e waking up groggy and trying to put his  shoes  on  it comes from the fact that he can t resist showing eve all the cool stuff he s collected over the years  it comes from the fact that he wants nothing more than to hold eve s hand  but when it really comes down to it he ll make sure she gets the plant to the holo detector so they can get back to earth  two characters who can barely speak and i feel i know them better than most human movie characters 100 favorite films   essential sci fi canontop 10 00 s sci fi   pixar   spaceship ",

    "i ll just say this  if this movie came out today  i would be tweeting about its never ending subversive brilliance all day every day  the spaceship pilots from 700 years in the past are portrayed by live action actors  showing how the humans essentially devolved into cartoons overtime   the story explicitly shows how massive unregulated corporations will destroy the world and then monetize its destruction and frame themselves as the savior   the technology in the story is framed as neither good nor evil  just a tool that can either enhance or restrict life   there are multiple overt 2001  a space odyssey references   it s a movie with almost no dialogue in the entire first half  just pure visual storytelling which endears the viewer to the characters immediately   the credits continue the story though cave drawings and hieroglyphics  highlighting the new start for humanity   we don t deserve this movie ",

    "i am absolutely disgusted by the negative stereotypes the media perpetuates about sentient computers with glowing red eyes  just because an artificial intelligence has a glowing red eye does not mean it is necessarily evil and wants to destroy humanity  this idea is repulsive  and it needs to stop ",

    "love builds its foundation within the confines of a physical landscape  but for love to flourish  the wide eyed gaze up into the ravishing void of the cosmos is the only way for euphoria and connection to be felt  not only a perfect film  but a profoundly moving symphony of emotion ",
    "stunning  way better for me as an adult than it was as a kid  the fact that wall e barely talks and yet manages to be one of the most well realized and charming characters in animated history speaks volumes  the environmental message is well handled  the romance is believable  the weak villain is really the only thing holding this back from a perfect score ",
    "i don t feel like going on about something right now  but i will say this wall e is the best love story i can think of  going back to at least when harry met sally  and one of the sweetest and most effective i ve ever seen   how far you have fallen so quickly pixar   after up  it has been nothing but down   ba dum bum ",
    "i am convinced that this film can turn cynics into kittenslawyers into human beingsdepression into tap danceme into a man shaped grinthe first half hour or so contains some of the best animation ever made  the rest consists of the usual pixar excellence ",
    "great movie about holding hands",
    "one of the best pixar films made  if you haven t seen wall e lately  watch it again  it s beautiful  emotional  mesmerizing  and fantastic  and it s some terrifically twisted irony that anyone could make me feel more for a robot than i do for most humans ",

    "pixar s 2001  i hadn t seen this film since my childhood  i remember liking it fine  but its silent cinema influences  specifically in the first 30 minutes  lost my interest back then  good thing i love silent cinema now and that i watched this with more mature eyes  this movie will warm your heart  make you laugh  make you think  and tear your heart out just like city lights or the kid does  wrecked me it did andrew stanton watched tons of chaplin and buster keaton films to mold this movie by  wall e is a hydraulic  metal  and binocular eyed version of the tramp  stanton clearly loves and understands silent cinema  so much so that he pitched this movie to criterion to get it published himself regarding its cinema influences  while also crafting such a thought provoking and richly thematic film  yes  the titular trash compacting robot is cute  so is chaplin s the tramp  they re both cute  full of wonder  and searching for love in a world that they look on with innocent eyes  wall e shoots through the solar system in search of his love  flying and dancing through open galaxy with eve just like the scene in hello  dolly  he obsessively watches over and over  all while getting humanity back in touch with what makes us human  this is an animation epic of space  love  and the pursuit of happiness  if we all could look at the world like wall e does the world would be a greater place  the animation looks incredible and the 4k transfer is spectacular by the way  author sam wasson describes this film as a mix of kubrick and chaplin  you can read his excellent criterion essay here    pixar films rankedwatched on the new criterion collection 4k           ",

    "say you started recycling  say you got all your friends to start recycling  say you got all your friend s friends to start recycling  keep going  it won t do much good  because it s not you and me and our plastic bottles that are killing the earth  not in any significant way  anyway  not in any way our changing our behaviors would do much good   not that it hurts to recycle  i support recycling  it s fun   but until we fight the corporate greed that fuels the blithe disregard for the causes of climate change  nothing will change  under capitalism  the environment is doomed  we must end the dictatorship of capital to save the world  that s not an exaggeration so the film s portrayal of earth s destruction being somewhat at the hands of a massive  uncaring  two faced corporate entity isn t wrong   it s hypocritical coming from a major capitalist entity like disney  but what isn t hypocritical about disney   it s just that message that follows is muddled  like most disney films of this era  the most blatant problem is  of course  the incredibly offensive portrayal of fat people  yes  i know every caveat about bone mass  gravity  their apparent agency toward the end  and so on  and i don t care  they are used as punchlines  shown to be seen as worthless until their laziness is overcome  there are repeated jokes at their expense  and contrasts shown to the past  making it clear the film views them as a dire warning  furthermore  the film shows that they got this way through trite science fiction tropes  media distraction  lives of leisure abetted by automation  isolation in space  what we see when human beings are given leisure is not  however  atrophy  but glory  innovation  creativity  we thrive when freed from the confines of oppression  we do not become lifeless  babbling drones  the implication is that some corporate agenda obscured the truth and tricked humanity into this idle existence  but that    well  that s cynical  for 700 years  we would resist  we always resist  we always change  that s the only truth there is  to pretend otherwise is either boring narrative contrivance or a deeply misanthropic view of human capacity  would we grow fat and happy  drifting through the solar system s wonders  perhaps  i hope so  even  would we do nothing with that happiness  absolutely not  we would create more wonders   the equation of  fat  with  idle  and  more subtly   worthless  is the most galling part  and that s what is infuriating here  the film shows wonders  saturn s icy rings    the film shows human achievement  the ship itself   the film shows relics of the past that indicate what we re capable of  i could pick a number of things  but i cannot resist the urge to go with hello  dolly   the film shows that its authors were aware that we re not  even in our most adverse situations  idle beings  but it seems to think we are easily pacified  easily quieted  it defies its own internal logic  it s an insult to us now and then  it could be seen as an environmental parable of what erasure brings  but the reawakening is so easily attained that it s inconceivable that no one in 700 years would have already achieved it  even without a plant coming back  it could be seen as a message about rebirth and redemption  but the villains are all dead  it has some side message about malfunctioning outcasts  but that s used mostly for humor  it could have some message about love  but    really  wall e spends a lot of time just mooning over eve s comatose body  what  the only thing this film has going for it is visual spectacle  and even that is mostly bogged down in a color palette of  mostly  blue and brown that fails to deliver on the wonders animation like this should deliver also  that bug disgusts me  and i could not look at it ",
    "even for pixar  wall e is something that this animation studio has accomplished for the very first time   is technically their most perfect film to date  surpassing their very own genre defining standards  pushing the boundaries of animation to an entirely new level   effortlessly transcending the conventions of its genre  wall e shows what animation is capable of when used as a medium to narrate a story   is one of the greatest achievements in the history of animation filmmaking set in a distant future  wall e paints a very bleak portrait of our planet that has been abandoned by mankind after it became too unfit to sustain human life and chronicles the adventures of a robot that was designed to clean up the whole mess  has been alone on the waste covered earth for centuries   has also developed sentience  when another robot named eve arrives to survey the planet  wall e falls in love with her at first sight   follows her into outer space on a journey that would change the fate of mankind co written   directed by andrew stanton  wall e marks another impressive high for the very filmmaker who previously dazzled the world with his breathtaking underwater adventure  finding nemo   this time  presents him raising the bar for movies set in outer space  while the fabulously written screenplay touches on current world issues like pollution  mass consumerism  sedentary lifestyle   dependence on technology amongst other things  it s how these themes are presented that makes wall e an instant classic opening with what isn t entirely an unrealistic view of our planet s future  the first act of wall e is also its strongest for the sequences set on earth are an absolute marvel to look at   even the storyline in this act makes minimal use of dialogues  relying mostly on visuals  humans do make their appearance from the second act onwards but it s the robots here in whom we invest our emotions with assured confidence  and they don t let us down for their arc is deftly written  carefully handled   confidently presented from the technical point of view  wall e is in a league of its own  production design team makes expert use of real world entities for its sets  cinematography is jaw dropping for it blends live action with 3d animation unlike anything seen or done before but as far as animation photography goes  it ends up setting new benchmarks with its inventive use of lighting  colour palettes  camera placements   focus shots for this picture is the closest animation has ever come to replicating live action cinema on the silver screen the computer animation has always been a state of the art aspect in pixar s features but in wall e  it opens up a wide range of possibilities for its medium unlike before   explores the new realms with sublime artistry  editing exhibits a steady control over its pacing   every frame throughout its 98 minutes of runtime serves a meaningful purpose in the end product  and then there is thomas newman s heartwarming score that makes wall e a deeply intimate  beautiful  touching  innocent   soul stirring experience the two adorable characters we have here in wall e  waste allocation load lifter   earth class    eve  extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator  are elegantly designed and express emotions so well that we are instantly connected to their thoughts without any requirement of verbal exposition  the entirety of wall e s expressions come from those binocular eyes   his rugged design fits the environment he works in while eve presents a much advanced technology   her precision finish resembles the design aesthetics found exclusively in apple products also  ever since 2001  a space odyssey happened  almost every single feature film set in outer space has gone on to pay homage to that quintessential sci fi classic yet of all the space operas out there  wall e is by far the best tribute to kubrick s magnum opus in my opinion for it treats that masterpiece s legacy with utmost respect but is also able to carve its own identity by retaining its originality  the film also makes reference to the 1969 musical hello  dolly  and in many ways  is a wonderful ode to various products by apple inc  as well on an overall scale  wall e is an immensely fascinating science fiction adventure  a whole heartedly mesmerising love story   a groundbreaking feat of computer animation  all extraordinarily intermixed into one profoundly moving  delightfully entertaining   thoroughly rewarding cinema that effectively addresses the themes of love  loneliness   companionship  and has a lot to say about our degrading environment  inactive lifestyle  consumerism   over reliance on technology  including where all this could lead us in the near future unless we decide to act whether you place it in the genre s  of sci fi  romance  adventure or comedy  wall e will manage to come out as a winner in all of them with effortless ease for it is a triumph in every filmmaking department   is a cinematic treasure that ll be cherished for decades to come  watching it only once isn t enough for the story unravels more of its depths on multiple viewings  one of the best films of its year  one of the finest films of its decade  one of the prime examples of its genre s    definitely amongst the greatest films ever made  wall e is an unprecedented feat of animation filmmaking that simply works ",

    "an enduringly frustrating film  aesthetically it represents the pinnacle of pixar s long quest toward digital perfection  creating images that are so lifelike  especially in this new dolby vision boosted criterion 4k  that the use of actual live action footage almost feels redundant  clips of an increasingly disheveled fred willard as ceo god king of earth are more cartoonish in both look and feel than almost anything in the first act  and the chaplinesque comedy and pathos in wall e and eve s interactions are truly graceful  the culmination of pixar s best attributes to that point  and one of the last demonstrations of them before that studio began its long slide to the middle  and a showcase of elegance that is all too rare in american animation  when the only living things on screen are robots  or a roach   this is one of the great achievements of the form  an extended pas de deux in which only a few makeshift vocalizations distract from much clearer communication without words and then  the humans turn up  and it s hard to even finish the damn thing  it s not even necessarily that the sub idiocracy depiction of humanity s last remnants as perfectly spherical  intellectually rotted consumers offends me  it s that the notion that mankind s dismal  privatized future will exist under the aegis of walmart and other treatmongers and not the technocrat overlords who d already emerged by the mid 2000s as the bloodless captains of tomorrow  i mean  fuck  pixar used to be the baby of steve fucking jobs  the roly poly treat children routine is a one note joke played ad nauseam so the film never has to engage with any remotely complex or real projections of what a race of humanity made up of a selected few would actually be like after centuries of what amounts to an endless spacex cruise  a cut of this movie with no humans  nier e   is an easy 5 5 masterpiece  with them  it settles for being merely one of the five best pixar movies  a designation that might once have sounded like a rave but these days feels like pure nostalgia for when this studio made things that were engaging ",

    "seeing a film released under disney that criticizes consumerist culture makes wall e feel like the product of a whole other era when you re considering where even pixar seems to have gone now   but during the 2000 s they ve had one of the most consistent runs any american animation studio could dream of  but that s not the only area where wall e still retains its magic  for i think it s representative of some of the most inventive visual storytelling that american animation can present on the screen  especially within the opening sequences on earth that center around wall e and eve  in these moments  andrew stanton and company have made the most out of the format as a visual medium   defining a world that s calling for help  especially as the remnants of our presence can only be felt through artificial intelligence this is top three pixar  on the count of being maybe their most visually gorgeous  because all of those space sequences  not on the axiom  are astonishing   evoking the feeling of being a remnant of the past ",

    "i d always feared revisiting this because i remembered the first half as masterful and the second half as mediocre  i was even more nervous when they leave earth barely after the 30 minute mark instead of an hour in like i d thought  but even though there s no beating the nearly wordless initial chunk  the 2nd act has a lot to offer  some really solid physical comedy   and it only really starts to lose steam in the last 15 minutes where the there s just a bit too much happening and it feels at odds with the rest of the film  it s still a masterful film  regardless of genre  there s a brilliant  relatively subtle moment when the first time eve says wall e s name  you see in his reaction how enchanted and delighted he is because he s never heard anyone else say his name before  i cried ",

    "truly the apotheosis of hateful ideology   wall e  is nothing more than a regressive paean to the horrors of capitalistic physicality  wall e  envisions a society that is free from work  hierarchy and stress of any kind and  rather than recognising this as the post scarcity paradise that this really is  proceeds to paint it as corrupt and decadent  instead   wall e  valourises the crude and rapacious acquisition of late  and early  stage capitalism  presenting a disingenuous argument for the  satisfaction  that  hard work  provides for a human being bullshit the reification of labour as the ultimate  calling  of humankind represents nothing more than the adoring fetishisation of the logic of accumulation and scarcity to which we are all cruelly bound  the film s denigration of a post scarcity  post hierarchical society and subsequent lionisation of our current brutal and brutish system only serves to crush the hopes of so many who dream of a utopic future   wall e  tells us that anything beyond the physical demands of work is corrupt and destined for failure and that we should not only maintain our current system of governance but that we should rejoice in it truly vile the ultimate irony of the film is that it is this very logic of capitalistic physicality that destroyed earth in the first place  humanity returning to earth simply to plunder and raze the planet once again is a devastating blow to the ideology that the film puts forward  the filmmakers no doubt expect the audience to some kind of positive juxtaposition between the dilapidated urban hellscapes and the wide open spaces of fledgling seedlings  when  if an ounce of thought is given to it  it is clear that these things are one and the same  even the seeds of hierarchy are seen rearing their ugly head once again  on the ship  the captain merely had symbolic power  vestigial remnants of the influence his position once wielded  while this is far from ideal  it still gives the audience hope that his office may  one day  disappear completely  it is certainly far better than what we see once humanity returns to earth  where the captain by virtue of his  superior knowledge   immediately begins directing his passengers in the best way to  farm   how long  i ask  before someone refuses  no doubt being used to the freedom that their previous societal structure provided them   how long before the captain decides that protesters must be brought to heel  the film fails to ask these questions as it is too busy fellating the capitalistic ideology it has perniciously wedded itself to  wall e  is truly an appalling and disgusting film and any logical  rational person would disown it for the subversive ideological trash that it is ",
    "geoff t s pixar marathon  9wall e  2008 it s always going to be a tough question  but what honestly is the film that defines pixar at their very best  is it the one that warms your heart the most  the one that feels the most mature  or could it simply just be the one that s the most visually stunning  when it comes to all of those fronts  wall e is very much at the top of the spectrum for me  andrew stanton had already done a more than credible job on finding nemo  and he followed that up with what i feel is a strong contender for the studio s most accomplished effort right from the start  we re presented with quite possibly one of the most bleak openings to any film  let alone that from the likes of disney and pixar  a large urban area that is devoid of any kind of life  with the only regiments being still standing skyscrapers  piles upon piles of garbage and the services of buy n  large  a massive corporation who have since evacuated the planet having failed to clean up the mess  which they likely helped to create  then there s wall e  the lone surviving of many trash compactor robots who spends his days roaming around cleaning up garbage and scavenging parts to stay running  unexpectedly  wall e is met with the arrival of eve  a droid sent from earth to scan for any kind of plant or specimen that could restore the planet back to living conditions  it becomes love at first sight as eve takes a liking to his clumsy behaviour and his collection of human artifacts the thing i admire most about this act is how it s able to advance the characters and narrative with minimal use of dialogue  this is especially true in regards to wall e  voiced by sound designer ben burtt   who is established as having a childlike fascination with human culture and a curiosity about his existence and purpose in life  not to mention the great use of the musical hello dolly   which represents wall e s desire to find true love and explore the outside world eventually the action shifts to axiom  a large scale space cruise that houses a population of humans who have become so obese  due to lack of gravity  that they remain confined to hover chairs and dependent on an empty  automated lifestyle  in control is the captain  who is surprised to find eve come back with something that could restore the earth  but the mutinous autopilot has other plans in store  which eventually puts wall e and eve in a race to save the day from a visual standpoint  wall e is a marvel  aside from the eerie landscapes of a trash covered earth and the large scale interiors of the axiom  few things memorise me more than wall e being able to see the beauty of the galaxy for the first time  or him and eve sharing a romantic moment together in space with a fire extinguisher  the only thing i could complain about is that the brief live action footage can be jarring  especially within the context of the animated world of course this being pixar  i wouldn t be able to forget the music  not just the use of  put on your sunday shoes  from hello dolly  or the occasional louis armstrong song  but thomas newman s scoring work  quirky and atmospheric  i dare say that it surpasses his work on nemo  the end theme sung by peter gabriel is also worth mentioning  which is nothing short of magical and ends the film on the relaxed note that it deserves ashamedly  this one pixar effort that i missed out on in a cinema  since  my first viewing  it s always been a massive favourite of mine  for pretty much every reason that i ve listed above  whether or not it s my all time favourite film from the team is hard to say  if i were to choose one that i d consider  perfect  however  it would definitely be one of the first to pop into my mind  i ve said all i need to say  all in all  a thrilling  colourful  and even hilarious sci fi adventure that enthrals and spellbinds from beginning to end  i can t recommend it enough 10 10",

    "over the past few years i have grown to deeply admire the silent era of cinema  a period that lasted from the birth of the medium until the end of the 1920 s  when i was younger i made the erroneous assumption that a silent film would equal a boring film  that a lack of verbal dialogue would lead to a disconnect between me and the narrative portrayed  and it simply isn t the case  the genuinely funny slapstick efforts of harold lloyd  buster keaton and charlie chaplin  the devastating power that lies in the eyes of renee falconetti  on trial for claiming she could speak directly with god  fritz lang crafting science fiction ahead of its time  bringing us the brilliant and bizarre performance from brigitte helm in front of a surreal  cityscape backdrop  silent films brought us characters that spoke to the audience without literally speaking  a feat that shouldn t be taken for granted  movement  mannerisms  and emotional depth portrayed through a look in the eyes  these were what made up a performance rather than the delivery of words  and when it was done right like some of the examples i mentioned above  it resulted in arresting  overwhelming cinema fast forward to 2008 when the world laid eyes on wall e  a film that benefits from all the bells and whistles of modern technology yet inside that glossy  gorgeously animated package is a tender  nuanced film with silent era sensibilities  we hear what amounts to dialogue between wall e and eve  but the literally robotic communication is limited and not what resonates with me  i fell in love with these characters and their story because of the clever  touching and beautifully realized ways they connect on a deep and profound level without being able to explain their thoughts and feels with coherent sentences  i am not one to bash the recent efforts by pixar studios because i have been able to have some fun with even their lesser work  i find the cars hatred to be rather silly because it s easy to assume creativity and the passion for the art should be first and foremost  but the truth is  disney loves money and cars is a massive financial winner for them  it would be a poor decision not to continue to make those films  no matter what critics say or people complain about  still though  i haven t felt the true magic of pixar in years  which is all the more frustrating because we know it is there  two robots look into each others eyes during wall e and say no words  yet i truly feel as if i can see into their souls  their happiness and their pain  everything they share together has an emotional core and shocking depth to it all that seems unfathomable given the fact that they literally have no heart  if you think you are too old for animation  you re not  if you think you won t believe in a love between two cute little robot characters  you will if you haven t yet seen wall e  you should check out this review on my blog  no blogging for old men",

    "i ve been sick in bed all day and i decided to watch wall e for some reason  i loved this film growing up  i ve seen this countless times  but i haven t seen this in quite a while  i m coming at this with rose tinted glasses  but to me i appreciate this in a lot more aspects than i did as a kid  it s one of those movies that i feel has improved for me after just seeing it for the first time in probably a decade  the main reason i have so much more appreciation for this movie now is cause of how refreshing it was to watch a solid pixar film that doesn t feel formulaic  i ve grown tired of a lot of pixar films in recent years just cause of how by the numbers most of them turn out being nowadays and going back to this movie was like wrapping myself in a warm blanket  for this movie to really only have 4 5 characters is really a risky move  not only that but the two main characters say only a few words for the first 30 45 minutes almost nobody talks and it s wonderful  all of the storytelling is done visually  you aren t told what happened to the world you see it  the animation is really great in this  that s kind of a given with pixar  but i found their style to really contrast well in this movie  there s a clear contrast in visuals between earth and the space ship and i found that differing style to be creative and a good way of establishing these different scenarios  my only real problem is the antagonist of the movie  i don t remember the robots name so i m just going to call it hal 9000  hal 9000 is really underdeveloped and you really don t get a good idea as to why they re keeping the humans on the ship  i found most of that to be too vague and would have done better with some more development as to why it was that way  overall this movie is great  it s in my top 100  but i don t got a list for that so i m just gonna say it s probably up there  if you haven t watched this movie go watch it  it s fun and for me it held the test of time ",
    "one of pixar s most visually beautiful movies  i like incredibles and ratatouille and even toy story more but wall e is easily the best looking pixar movie ever  i m not talking about quality of animation i m talking about how every shot could be a painting  hell  it s also one of the most beautiful because of its message and story  late 2000s pixar is something else  man ",
    "embarrassed to be watching this 13 years late but this very much is the greatest love story ever told",
    "a wonderful movie about how holding hands and dancing is the most romantic thing you can do",
    "probably my favorite of pixar s films  not considering that i haven t actually seen many   i can probably owe that to my love of creative sci fi flicks   and this one is incredibly creative  from the point that the characters  both human and anthropomorphized robots are fully understandable just by the actions they take with near zero dialogue to the world building involved   as normal pixar presents some golden life messages here  like the importance of friendship  self sacrifice  the limits of mortality  and the possibilities of technology   i m not typically into kids cartoons  but this one is very entertaining while delivering a positive message   i ll likely be one of the few  if not the only pixar film that makes my movies to watch before you die list movies i suggest everyone watch before they die2008 ranked2000 s rankedscience fiction films rankedscience fiction films in the 2000 s rankedromance films rankedanimated films rankeddystopian futures rankedkiller robots rankedspace travel rankedbest for young children ranked",
    "despite being an animated film with minimal dialogue  pixar s wall e  2008  packs a serious emotional punch as it targets tough topics  like consumerism  corporatocracy  environmental degradation  obesity  waste management  and more  romance is one of those things you expect to be very surface level in animated films  but wall e  2008  pulls out the stops and a few classic tunes to show that there s a market for realistic emotion in the genre  which pixar would capitalize on down the road in films like up  2009  and inside out  2015   the blend of real human actors with animated ones occasionally wanders a bit too close to anchors aweigh  1945   mary poppins  1964   and who framed roger rabbit  1988  for my taste  but generally speaking the state of the art cgi animation is excellent and still fairly impressive don t just watch a clip of titular wall e  2008  and eve  dancing  in space while louise armstrong belts a cover of la vie en rose  1947   you deserve the full spectacle of this beloved non conventional science fiction romance film ",

    "film  92 that was recommended to me    now subject to loose  arbitrary ranking   recommended by yondu4 i d like to be more into this  let s be honest    pixar movies  for all the love that they get  are pretty simple and formulaic  it s basic storytelling and the manipulations are clear and upfront  there s not even an attempt to mask the tugging at heartstrings  and generally  i m someone who is totally susceptible to that  because they do it well  i am happy to let myself be led by the nose from emotion to emotion  whizzing by the exact narrative developments i saw coming when i read the premise  with some pretty  highly polished animation along the way  when wall e and eve are at the forefront  that s exactly what i get yet  everything about life on the axiom in this film grosses me out  treating earth as a planet too trashed to be habitable is relevant  we re trying our hardest to make that a reality  so far so good  rather than perishing with the planet  in wall e we escaped to the stars  i m generally critical of movies that present a scientific miracle solution to this problem that needed to be addressed politically long ago  a problem that can even be put off through imagining we ll somehow get saved in the end    but wall e is critical of life on the ship and yearns to return to earth  so that s not really my issue  side note  though  i have to wonder how many people didn t escape  it s implied that there are more ships  though i have serious doubts that those of lower class got their own  after all  these ships are essentially the continuation of a corporate control of society  life on the ships appears  despite the ads and other holdovers from our capitalist world  money less and work less  beyond a single captain   yet surely there was an upfront cost  i ll forgive a pixar film for not going into the dark details of how many people were left for dead  heh  although i think completely ignoring it reinforces an understanding of our relationship with science as a get out of crisis free card that is purely egalitarian  nonetheless  my issue is actually with the way life on this ship is criticized the population of the axiom represents sloth taken to its extreme  everyone glides around on chairs that they never leave  they have no need for work  their needs are met by automation  they stare at screens all day and forget there is a world around them  there s a lot to unpack here  but what immediately jumps out is how identically fat everyone is  the thermian argument will tell us that they have to gain weight and lose the ability to walk  as they ve ceased all physical activity  but it s undeniably making a statement to write a  bad  society primarily marked by fatness and laziness intertwined as one  these people damn near roll around like balls and are only shaken from their stupor to drink processed food  it s insulting  there s a fine line in critiquing mindless consumerism without blaming the individuals  and this is way off  playing their fixation on technology as a joke where they literally do not recognize the world around them is peak boomer yelling at clouds  it s  my kids grandkids look at their phones too much  pathologized  so hard that a whole dystopia was written about it  is what s on the screen designed to prey on people s addictions to make them unable to look away  hell if i know  this movie does not care one bit what s on the screens  and that s how you know it regards the very screen itself as the problem the worst part of all of this  though  is how we get there  the ultimate problem that sent society on this downward spiral is    everyone s needs were met  people were given free time and luxuries  it s a terribly regressive ideology  one of the saddest things right now is that we have to be afraid of automation  automation should be an incredible achievement  freeing up more and more hours of human life to pursue our own desires  instead  they improve profit margins and destroy lives as  jobs disappear   in a sane world  we d celebrate disappearing jobs  wall e goes a step further and says that  if we re made too comfortable  we ll just lie down and never get up again  this is  frankly  reactionary bullshit  on the whole  humans desire to do and make things  and to have connections with one another  these people have all of the time they could ever want to get more connected with friends and loved ones  to make art  to pursue anything that millions wish they could do right now if their jobs didn t eat up their time and exhaust them  the quest to return to earth is one that is half reasonable because this artificial habitat is likely limited in its possibilities and is no match for the natural world  yet i can t shake the feeling that the main reason this movie wants everyone to get back to the planet is so that they can struggle again  finally  they can have lives filled with labor  tending to the plants and cleaning up the trash  left to their own devices  they re fucking useless  real touching i probably should dislike this more than i do  because it s filled with implications that genuinely anger me  but that pixar shine does make it hard to have a bad time  no matter how hackneyed their relationship  the robots are sweet together  they re just a couple cuties trying to hang out amidst the backdrop of all of this nonsense  next time give me more robot dates and less fat people hate ",
    "this is one of the most precious movies in existence and i would kill a man for wall e  i will defend him until i die",
    "wall e is one of the cutest characters to ever exist",
    "a masterpiece in its own class    andrew stanton has delivered three incredible pixar films in his time there and he doesn t get enough credit ",
    "one of pixars best films  its also one of its darkest films   with themes about society  economy  consumerism and technology  its also a sweet love story and a comedy  the first twenty minutes are like a sillent comedy with wall e being a charliie chaplin type character  my favourite part of the film  its got nice light moments such as wall e with a fire extinguisher in space and lots of action setpieces ",
    "i just realized i don t have a proper review for wall e  i think wall e is debatably the best pixar film to date  in my opinion  its in the same tier as the incredibles and ratatouille  but what makes this movie so great  so to begin  let s talk about the heavily praised opening of the movie  it s perfection  i use this phrase all the time  as do comp i english teachers throughout the ages  but writing is all about showing and not telling  and a way that forces a writer to do this is to focus on characters that don t speak  i e wall e  it s no stretch at all to say that the first 20 or so minutes of this movie is masterful visual storytelling  within 3 minutes we completely understand the world as well as our protagonist  and wisely we are shown for the next 15 minutes the depths of wall e s personality and his morality  and once this opening chunk of the film is wrapping up  the character eva is introduced wonderfully  she is the perfect compliment to wall e  i know pixar s stories almost always have two highly contrastable characters go on a adventure misadventure together  woody   buzz  marlin and dory  mike and sully  joy and sadness etc   but this might actually be my favorite pairing they ve ever had  and what separates these two from the pack is their cuteness  as a matter of fact  this film as a whole is absolutely freaking adorable   there is no character in the past  let s just say 30 years as lovable as wall e   and eva is quite the heart melter herself  this movie is literally like watching cute dog videos for two hours  but with a rock solid  highly entertaining story behind it all  and underneath all the cuteness and heart warming bliss is animated perfection  this movie is a technical marvel  especially at the time  even for pixar  i ve always adored when they re leaving earth and just floating in space  taking their time to stop and smell the roses so to speak  it s a scene that reminds the audience about the message of the film  which is to cherish the natural beauty around us  while also allowing the animation staff to flex every muscle they have  i m a sucker for a sci fi film with heart and this film uses its visuals to show its warm  gooey center  i will say though  despite all the excellence of wall e  i m a little underwhelmed by the third act  more specifically the humans on axiom  i know this movie is an extreme not so extreme exploration of what humans could look like in the not so distant future  but only seeing morbidly obese slobs playing on tablets while consuming absurd amounts of garbage and literally not knowing how to function outside of chairs seems a little much  i think it didn t need to be as black and white as it was and a little more nuance  which this movie excels at 80  of the time  would ve been nice  but that s essentially my only complaint with the movie  it s an incredible film  wall e is an all timer in my book favorites",
    " the little engine that could who fell in love  there s just so much good here  the dedication of our titular robot thematically defines the film from start to finish  in fact said dedication defines each of the three acts  manifesting itself in three different ways  duty  love  and purpose  it nails all three our little robot is dedicated  committed  and brave  but most of all  he s inspirational another masterpiece from pixar s run of  near  perfection ",

    "jeff garlin s character looks like nikocado avocado",
    "i will keep this short and sweet  the first half of this film is astounding and impressive on every level  much like a silent film it shows everything visually that it needs to set up the story  from the aching loneliness of our protagonist doomed to clean up the literal wasteland that is earth  to the characters of wall e and eve striking up a delightful relationship that is communicated through subtle moments of wonder and affection  just watch the slap stick silent film moments that plague him whilst he voyeuristically watches her   the way wall e excitedly shows off all his collectibles as a way of connection or the utter heartbreak as the connection is cut off and he tries to regain it through some touching scenarios the film follows a much more familiar route in the second half which is by no means an issue with the film   up  follows the exact same path  but it s just that there is a noticeable tonal shift once dialogue comes into play and with the narrative becoming more action driven that one longs for more of the perfection displayed in the first half  2001  a space odyssey references are playful and fun but are well worn this at this stage in film evolution  but that is still hardly a mark against this wonderful film wall e is top shelf pixar and a film that i come back to quite regularly  especially for the note perfect first half  there is such beauty  subtlely and craft at work here that it transcends animation and stands as a film to be adored and respected ",
    "one of pixar s best  there is practically no dialogue for the first 20 30 minutes of this movie  yet it s as entertaining as any other pixar film  not only that  the rest of the film works extremely well too  wall e and eva are both two of pixar s most likable characters  and the animators only really had body movements to express their emotions  that is an achievement in it s own right  the only weak part of this film is the villain  i could barely tell what their motives were  other than that though  this is a fantastic movie and probably a top five pixar for me ",

    "the weekly animation challenge 2018week 39  pixar  there were a couple big reasons i shouldn ta liked wall e as much as i did  number one  adorable cockroach sidekick   i m in texas y all  a place with cockroaches big enough to have their own zipcode  ain t nothin  cute about it  that leads into number two  this movie is so emotionally manipulative of a giant softy like me that i kinda wanna shoot it with my own laser cannon  hadn t felt this played since ben made me cry over a fucking rat but who can resist the eternally concerned looking tilt of wall e s eyes  especially when he rubs his little hands together like butters from south park  who   judging by the near universal acclaim this film still receives   not many of you  and as much praise as the animation rightfully gets for creating this endearing character and the marvelous world he inhabits  the real star of the film for me is ben burtt  the r2 d2 esque voice of wall e and probably the greatest sound effects artist we ve ever had  it s not just burtt s central performance but his brilliant  meticulous  richly textured soundscape that pushes this frequently dialogue free animated feature out of this world so yes  with so much capable audio visual artistry that manages to plug in a world of leftover trash   robot artifice to real emotions conveyed with boundless heart  humor  and energy  i was taken in by it all  as for the film s moral messaging  it was also all stuff i could appreciate  no  creepy conglomerates consumerism pollution are all bad news  no i don t think  florida but on a giant spaceship  sounds like a good idea  yes  jeff garlin is priceless  in some ways this whole thing felt like pixar returning to their roots  to that first short about an animated lamp named luxo  his offspring  and that precarious fragile spinning ball they distract themselves with  but returning to it now with all the wisdom and skill they ve acquired since then  this time the intergenerational implications are a little more dire  but the inherent wonder of being alive that was present even early on is now more palpable than ever  and the universe really is so beautiful once we re able to look beyond our own trash ",
    "love s serenity muted in the calm backdrop of the stars   does love need words  sometimes the intuitive feeling of the moment can take over with a glance  love at first sight  seizing time   pixar works on an emotionally elemental field here  sure the enviro friendly save earth green message is there and in plain sight  and the hope for a home to go back too  but this positive planetary outlook is some really great stuff to install in a kids learning mind  nonetheless  the story and message are still rudimentary in high and sight because the beautifully astral embrace you feel when rifting on the stellar dust with wall e and eve is nothing short of everything film could harness  a godly magical cascade of electricity intangibly flowing from the screen  to your face  and through your body  a twinkle of relation so palpably endearing and cute  try resisting  wall e is seriously one of animation s great characters  his quirks  mannerisms and overall personality are so well realized for a voiceless character  bettering most silent films i ve ever seen   the animation is brightly graceful  comicy  and chalky and clean all at the same time   boy any help from roger deakins wont be turned down either  his visual consultation helped in some way because visually its hard to look better quality wise or be more expressive in terms of movement and composition as wall e   thomas newman s score  especially   define dancing is richly moving  the film is just an absolute powerhouse  what else have we come to expect from pixar though  honestly  there such a strange little studio  pioneers of creativity and vision  then they dabble with toy cars and unwanted sequels   it just makes me wonder  not to fear as long as they release something of wall e quality every half decade or so i will be happy  inside out is sufficiently covering my fix for now  i ll be waiting ",

    "the point after which pixar had nothing left to prove  if they could make wall e  there is presumably no limit on what they can make  except for their creativity  even the very best of their pre 2008 work has in some capacity started to show its age  as has some of their post 2008 work  if we are being honest   but not a frame of wall e has aged even a day  and it s not just bleeding edge photorealism that puts it in such authoritative command of the medium  this is an exceptionally sophisticated piece of visual storytelling  by any standards at all  not just the ones by which we judge animation  but that s also not entirely fair  since only in animation  only in computer animation  to be precise  could some of these visuals exist  the broadest scale visual strategy   shaky handheld with lots of racking focus on earth  glass smooth pans and tracking shots whipping around effortlessly through tight curves in infinitely deep focus on the axiom   relies extensively on the particular manipulation of the virtual camera that digital layout allows for  and on top of all the other hyperbole i could throw out there  this is  minus   perhaps   into the spider verse  the most elegant  creative  and narratively insightful layout in all of cg animation  the shot of wall e getting buried beneath shopping carts  while eve shakes her head dismissively in the foreground  out of focus  so mightily impressed me and continues to impress me that my entire academic research program was inspired by it but more than the exquisite  way this marshals all the elements of visual filmmaking to create a world and tell a simple but deeply charming story in it  where this really demonstrates a genius level understanding of the affordances of the medium is in the character animation of wall e and eve  particularly the former  who exploits all of the strengths of 3d cgi character animation and falls prey to none of the weaknesses  his design is perfect for the medium  he s made entirely out of rigid metal pieces connected at articulation points  and those points have been so ingeniously positioned as to allow him the most bottomlessly appealing range of expressions of any computer animated character on the books  indeed  his immaculate broad pantomime   and notwithstanding ben burtt s career peak work in giving wall e an adorable synthetic voice that communicates so much with a vocabulary of fewer than ten words  this is a character based in pantomime   isn t terribly far behind dumbo  the all time masterpiece of wordlessly emotive character animation  in terms of the pure emotionalism is able to extract from him and yes  the stock complaint   it gets worse once they arrive on the axiom  and worse again once we learn what s up with the autopilot  but a  that s  worse  than such astronomic heights that even the  bad  parts would still keep this in my top 4 pixar films  b  is it actually worse  it s different  and probably less  sophisticated   but the contrasts between the first and second halves is so obviously the point  reinforcing the theme and creating protracted moods that are then reinforced by thomas newman s best ever score  which navigates between staccato synthetic rhythms and weightless strings and adventure movie bombast fluidly and almost always in surprising ways  or  in the case of the divine  define dancing  scene  unsurprising ways that make one s heart full enough to explode  previously reviewed at alternate ending ",
